# Requirements

- Arduino 1.0.5 to open project.  Later versions do not seem to open the project file.
- The GT2560 board is programmed with the "Arduino as ISP" programmer type.

# Other Prusa i3 Notes

- Make sure your heatbed mounting springs are not too compressed to prevent damage to the glass in case of an accidental collision from the extruder (i.e. if the Z-axis endstop malfunctions)
